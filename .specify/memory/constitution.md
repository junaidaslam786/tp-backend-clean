## 1. Core Mission

Develop a comprehensive, trustworthy threat profiling and compliance management platform that enables organizations to:

- Assess cybersecurity readiness against evolving threats
- Identify potential threat vectors and control gaps
- Evaluate compliance maturity against ASD Essential Eight (E8) and ISM controls (initial focus), with extensibility for additional frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, CIS, ISO 27001)
- Provide prioritized, evidence-backed, and actionable mitigation recommendations

Success Criteria:

- Measurable reduction of user risk exposure over time
- Clear, explainable scoring methodology accepted by stakeholders
- Repeatable, auditable assessments producing consistent outputs

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

### 2.1 Security First

- Secure-by-design and secure-by-default posture
- Enforce strong authentication (MFA / FIDO2 where feasible); prohibit weak credential patterns
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data in transit (TLS ≥1.3) and at rest (FIPS 140-2 validated algorithms where applicable)
- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with just-in-time elevation for administrative tasks
- Defense-in-depth: layered controls across identity, network, application, and data planes
- Segregation of duties across operational, development, and assessment functions
- Secure secret management (no secrets in code; use vault-backed rotation)
- Threat modeling embedded in feature design reviews
- Secure SDLC with mandatory code review, SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, SBOM generation

### 2.2 User-Centric Design

- Intuitive, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA) interface with progressive disclosure of complexity
- Tiered subscription model with transparent feature differentiation (e.g., Core, Pro, LE / multi-tenant)
- Self-service onboarding plus guided assessment workflows
- Clear remediation narratives (what / why / how / priority / effort)
- Exportable, non-proprietary data outputs (JSON, CSV, PDF) without vendor lock-in
- Respect user mental models—consistent terminology, minimal configuration burden
- Clear data lineage and provenance displayed for key findings

### 2.3 Flexibility & Scalability

- Modular service architecture and domain-driven design boundaries
- Multi-tenant isolation (logical and optional physical for higher tiers)
- Horizontal scalability through stateless services and message-driven workflows
- Framework abstraction layer allowing dynamic addition of new compliance or threat models without core refactor
- Configuration-as-data (versioned) for scoring weights, control mappings, and framework deltas
- Event-driven extensibility (webhooks / future API integrations)

### 2.4 Transparency & Auditability

- Append-only, tamper-evident audit logging for authentication events, configuration changes, assessments, and exports
- Traceability chain: Assessment -> Evidence -> Control Mapping -> Framework Source
- Deterministic scoring algorithms (documented, versioned) with rationale accessible in UI and API
- Full export of raw assessment artefacts for independent validation
- Data retention windows configurable per tenant with defensible defaults

### 2.5 Continuous Improvement

- Continuous ingestion of curated threat intelligence (validated sources; deduplicated) feeding pattern & control relevance updates
- Feedback loop for user validation of findings and false positive triage
- Quarterly framework delta review against upstream authoritative publications
- Living roadmap published internally; sanitized roadmap optionally shared with customers
- Blameless post-incident reviews with required action item closure tracking

---

## 3. Ethical Commitments

### 3.1 Data Privacy

- Data minimization: collect only necessary artefacts & metadata
- Explicit consent and transparent privacy notices for each data category
- Regional data residency support aligned with tenant requirements
- Cryptographic erasure upon tenant off-boarding (documented process)
- Support for data subject rights (access, correction, deletion) within SLA
- Maintain Record of Processing Activities (RoPA)

### 3.2 Responsible Disclosure & Communication

- Balanced, context-rich risk articulation (no fear-based language)
- Provide mitigation pathways proportionate to risk severity & exploitability
- Confidential handling of client environment insights; no cross-tenant leakage
- Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policy published; security.txt maintained
- Rapid response workflow for material scoring or framework misclassification defects

---

## 4. Technical Integrity

- Engineering standards codified as automated quality gates (CI policy as code)
- Strict error taxonomy (user error vs system fault vs external dependency) with structured logging
- Graceful degradation: partial feature outage must not compromise security guarantees
- Performance SLOs: p95 API latency targets documented; error budget tracked
- Resilience via circuit breakers, exponential backoff, idempotent operations
- Observability: metrics, logs, traces correlated with unique request IDs
- Regular chaos & failover drills in non-production and scheduled production game days

---

## 5. Collaboration & Openness

- Internal engineering & security knowledge base continuously updated
- API-first approach with published versioned OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs
- Integration-friendly design (SIEM/SOAR/export connectors roadmap)
- Clear external developer guidelines and sandbox environment (future milestone)
- Cross-functional governance forum (Security, Product, Engineering, Compliance) meets monthly

---

## 6. Governance & Decision-Making

Roles:

- Product Steering Group: prioritization & roadmap alignment
- Security Architecture Board: approves security-affecting design changes
- Data Protection Officer (or delegate): privacy impact reviews
- Incident Response Lead: coordinates security incident lifecycle

Decision Model:

- Default to RFC-style lightweight design proposals for material changes
- Approval requires quorum (≥ 2 domain leads + security) for security-impacting features
- Tie-breaker: documented rationale & retrospective review after 1 release cycle

---

## 7. Change Management & Versioning

- Constitution changes via Pull Request referencing rationale & impact
- Semantic Versioning of scoring models & framework mappings (MAJOR = breaking interpretation, MINOR = additive, PATCH = corrections)
- Changelog maintained inline (Section 14)

## 8. Compliance & Legal Alignment

## 9. Risk Management

- Central risk register with owner, likelihood, impact, treatment plan
- Continuous control effectiveness evaluation based on telemetry & assessment feedback
- Threat modeling repository (STRIDE / attack path analysis) per critical service
- Key systemic risks (e.g., supply chain, privilege escalation, data exfiltration) tracked with mitigating controls status
